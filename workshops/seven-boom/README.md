# Background
This project contains a simple counter component.
By clicking "+" the value will increment, and by clicking "-" the value will decrement.
This is how the counter looks like now:

# The goal
Turn this boring counter into an awesome 7 boom game!
7 boom is a simple game - you start counting, and as soon as you get to a number that is either:
a. Contains "7"
b. Can be divided by 7
You say "BOOM!" instead of the number.
So this is what your game should look like after you change the code:

# What you need to do:
1) Run the tests using the command 'npm run test', all tests should pass  
2) Add your changes, see file ```counter-component.js``` (turn the counter into a "7-boom" game)  
3) Run the tests again using 'npm run test', some tests should fail now  
4) Open the file ```counter-component.test.js```, make sure you understand why those particular tests failed  
5) Fix the test  
6) Run the command 'npm run test', all tests should pass again
